        <p>A phylum of predominantly sessile, filter-feeding marine invertebrates, with a ciliated, tentaculate feeding organ or lophophore and a bivalved shell. The two main living types (with either articulated or inarticulated valves) first appeared in the Lower Cambrian. Articulated forms give the phylum its common name: 'lamp shells'. In recent molecular analyses, brachiopods and phoronids form a single clade.</p>

      <p>Fine, chitinous bristles (setae or chaetae) emerge from
the larval epithelial surface of all except thecideidine
larvae, and from the marginal mantle grooves of the majority
of adult brachiopods. These setae sense local conditions
and protect the feeding gape. In burrowing linguloids the
setae play an important role in directing the movement of
sediment grains. Chitinous setae with very similar
ultrastructure and mode of formation also occur in some other
lophotrochozoans (e.g. annelids).</p>
      <p>The ontogenetically anterior–dorsal valve of
brachiopods (sometimes termed ‘dorsal’), is better known by its
traditional name, ‘brachial valve’, which reflects the
support it generally gives to the left and right ‘arms’ (or
brachia) of the lophophore. Similarly, the ontogenetically
posterior–dorsal valve (sometimes termed ‘ventral’) is also
better known by its old name, ‘pedicle valve’, because it
often surrounds or partly houses this stalk (where present).</p>
      <p>The common name for brachiopods, ‘lamp-shell’, derives
from a fancied similarity of the rhynchonelliform pedicle
valve to a pottery oil-lamp with its wick in the pedicle
aperture. Newly settled brachiopods attach more-or-less
permanently to a mineral substrate by means of fine rootlets
(many rhynchonelliforms) or cement at the end of the
pedicle (lingulates), or by cementing the pedicle valve directly
to the substrate (craniates and thecideidines). The smallest
living adult brachiopods are c. 1 mm long; the largest c.
100 mm, but 10–30 mm is more typical. Some fossil forms
grew much larger. Lifespan may be c. 3–30 years or more.</p>
      <p>The two main clades of living brachiopods differ in the
way the paired shell valves operate. In the articulated
rhynchonelliforms, opposed muscle pairs inserted on the
valves create lever arms around the tooth-and-socket
hinge, and thus open the valves for feeding, or shut them
for protection. Other muscles serve to adjust the position of
the shell relative to the pedicle (where present). These are
the limits of rhynchonelliform activity. In inarticulated
linguliforms, where there is no hinge and the shell valves
are joined only by muscles, they are opened by indirect
muscle action, working through coelomic fluid pressure,
and closed by direct muscle action. Where the pedicle valve</p>

is cemented to the substrate (craniates and some
discinoids) the feeding gape is closed by muscles that pull the
brachial valve into close contact with the substrate.
Linguloids burrow by the action of muscles that rotate one
valve against the other in a scissors-like action that enables
the setae to brush sediment particles backwards. Such
burrowing is the most active behaviour of extant
brachiopods; it has persisted since the Early Cambrian, leading to
the common misdescription of linguloids (e.g. Lingula) as a
‘living fossil’. It is a surprisingly complex behaviour: in an
aquarium, exposed animals have been observed to use their
muscular pedicle to arch themselves until the shell gape
points downwards and to work for several hours to reform
and reenter a U-shaped burrow.</p>
      <p>In all extant brachiopods much of the space between the
valves forms a mantle cavity, containing the bilaterally
symmetrical lophophore; only a small portion of the space
is occupied by body organs. Ciliated tracts line the
lophophore tentacles and arms, which adopt various lineage- and
growth stage-specific folds and coils. The
laminarflow feeding current passes through the lophophore where
food particles (mostly phytoplankton) are captured
(Figures 3–5). Particles are moved by ciliary currents along
the lophophore arms to a central, slit-like mouth, through

which they enter a muscular pharynx, a short oesophagus,
a distended stomach and a hind gut. Digestion is partly
intracellular, within a digestive gland that opens off the
stomach. In rhynchonelliforms there is no anus; waste solids
are voided through the mouth. In lingulates, the gut
recurves to a right-sided anus that opens into the mantle
cavity. In craniates the anus is median, and does not open into
the mantle cavity.</p>
      <p>Brachiopods have no head, but a nerve cord with ganglia
circles the oesophagus and nerves radiate widely. In
addition to setae, some developmental stages have statocysts
and eyespots. The circulatory system is not well known but,
where studied, is open, with one or more contractile
‘hearts’. Coelomic canals extend along the lophophore
arms and into the epithelium that lines the mantle cavity,
where gonads develop from coelomic epithelium. Germ
cells escape through paired metanephridia that open into
the mantle cavity (Figure 2). Sexes are generally separate,
though some brachiopods may be hermaphrodites.
Fertilization is external, and some or all of the fertilized eggs
may be brooded for a while, either in the lophophore or in a
special brood chamber. Lingulate embryos develop into
long-lived, planktotrophic juveniles with a rudimentary
shell, and have high dispersal potential, but
rhynchonelliform larvae are lecithotrophic, and generally settle and
metamorphose quickly, without feeding. Their dispersal
potential is, therefore, generally low. However, some
Antarctic rhynchonelliform larvae may spend months in the
plankton.</p>
      <p>The brachiopod shell and its superficial periostracum are
formed by cells of the mantle epithelium at the commissure
where the valves meet, and it is continuously remodelled
(especially the lophophore support or ‘loop’ of
terebratulids) as the animal grows. Both the periostracum and shell
are complex, layered structures that show important
differences in ultrastructure and composition both between
lineages, and between pre and postsettlement
developmental stages. The primary (sub-periostracal) shell layer is
typically granular, the secondary and tertiary (inner) layers,
where present, fibrous, laminar or prismatic. In craniates,
the proteinaceous periostracum is underlain by laminae of
protein-associated calcite (crystalline calcium carbonate),
whereas in lingulates (e.g. Lingula, Glottidia and Discinisca),
a chitinous periostracum is underlain by an organic matrix
hardened by granules of apatite (calcium phosphate). In
embryonic discinoids (e.g. Discinisca), minute siliceous
tablets are embedded in the embryonic shell surface; a rare use
of silica by triploblastic metazoans. In many brachiopods
(craniates and most rhynchonelliforms but not lingulates)
the shell is almost penetrated by closely spaced pores
(caecae) lined by mantle epithelium. These may be storage
organs: when nutrients are plentiful the caecal epithelium may
contain up to half the total organic matter, but their
evolutionary origins and functions remain somewhat
mysterious and they are absent from some extant lineages. Various
fossils that may have been stem group brachiopods (e.g.</p>
      <p>Mickwitzia, Micrina) are more or less covered with tubular
shell pores that appear to have housed setae, while
polyplacophoran mollusc (chiton) shells contain pores (called
aesthetes) analogous to brachiopod caecae. In some
rhynchonelliforms calcitic spicules may reinforce the mantle and
lophophore soft tissues.</p>
      <p>Structure, development and function of the pedicle
varies. In craniates and thecideidines, there is no pedicle and
the pedicle valve or its periostracum is cemented directly to
the substrate. In some discinoids a short pedicle emerges
from a notch in the valve (Figure 1) and is cemented to the
substrate. In most rhynchonelliforms the end of the pedicle
forms a holdfast, which is cemented to the substrate. The
rhynchonelliform pedicle may be short and rigid or long
and flexible, and the shell can often be rotated around it.</p>
      <p>The pedicle may be lost in some rhynchonelliforms that
become free lying after outgrowing a small initial anchor.</p>
      <p>The pedicle reaches its greatest development in linguloids
which, uniquely among brachiopods, burrow into soft
sediments. The linguloid pedicle is a protrusible, muscular
organ (supposedly edible), used for burrowing, shell
orientation and rapid retraction.</p>
      <p>Habitats, Diversity and Abundance
Brachiopods are strictly marine. They predominantly
occupy low energy, often cryptic, habitats such as rocky
overhangs below the level of wave action, crevices in reefs,
submarine caves, the steeper slopes of the continental shelf,
or abyssal deep waters. A few articulates (e.g. Notosaria and
Calloria in New Zealand, Terebratalia on the Pacific coast of
North America, Kraussina on the South African coast) may
be found in more energetic locations (e.g. attached to kelp
holdfasts) or even in very sheltered sites in the low inter-tidal
zone (e.g. under rocks). The pedicles of most
rhynchonelliforms attach to mollusc or (very often) other brachiopod
shells, as well as to seaweed, rock, gravel, or even coarse sand.</p>
      <p>The smallest living brachiopod (Gwynia) lives interstitially,
in gravel. The least typical brachiopod habitat is occupied by

      <p>The inhalant current enters at the sides and the exhalant current leaves
centrally. In many fossil and extant deep-water forms, the inhalant and
exhalant currents are offset by a median fold or groove in the shell,
presumably to minimze recirculation of filtered water. This animal’s shell is
about 40 mm across. (From a photograph provided by L. Shackleton,

the extant linguloids Glottidia and Lingula, which burrow in
soft sediments, as their ancestors have done since the Early
Cambrian. See also: Marine communities</p>
      <p>Although most biologists have never seen a living
brachiopod, they are actually widely distributed and may be
locally quite common (Figures 4 and 5). Over 100 genera,
mostly rhynchonelliforms, have been recognized among the
living fauna while about 5000 fossil genera have been
described. As expected for animals with nonfeeding larvae
that settle rapidly, rhynchonelliforms show considerable
geographic differentiation, with distinctive constellations of
endemic genera in marine provinces such as Antarctica,

New Zealand, the North Pacific, etc. Because most larvae
settle rapidly, astonishingly dense populations may form,
with thousands of individuals per square metre over large
areas of suitable substrate, e.g. several endemic
rhynchonelliforms on sub-vertical fjord walls in New Zealand,
Terebratulina unguicula in a similar situation in British
Columbia, and Terebratulina retusa in Scottish sea-lochs.</p>

the Recent counterparts of localized Cretaceous
populations inferred to have inhabited methane and sulfide
coldseep sites, but chemosymbionts of living brachiopods are
not known; seep populations presumably feed on associated
chemotolerant or chemosynthetic microorganisms.
Brachiopods are not important members of the characteristic
fauna of hydrothermal vents associated with mid-ocean
spreading ridges. See also: Deep ocean ecosystems
Habits and Life Histories
All brachiopods reproduce sexually, generally with
separate sexes and approximately equal sex ratios (where
known) and a standard haploid gamete/diploid zygote
reproductive cycle, but a few may be hermaphroditic.
Larvae and adults are diploid, with meiosis producing typical
oocytes and sperm. Genomic deoxyribosenucleic acid
(DNA) content (where known) is among the lowest for
metazoans (c. 4 108 bp per haploid genome), with seven or
eight small chromosomes. The ciliated embryos of
lingulates hatch from small eggs and spend months as juveniles,
feeding in the plankton. They are therefore widely
distributed; one tiny discinoid (Pelagodiscus) is literally
cosmopolitan. All other brachiopod larvae (craniate inarticulates
and all rhynchonelliforms) develop from larger, yolky eggs
and typically settle and metamorphose within a few days of
release. In rich environments (e.g. a Scottish sea-loch),
spawning is typically annual or biannual, with a
Terebratulina female of average size releasing about
10 000 eggs from relatively massive gonads. Where food is
scarce (e.g. in deep oceanic water), individuals may form
mature gametes only rarely. At settlement, larvae are
negatively phototropic and able to select suitable substrates.</p>
      <p>Because their larvae generally settle soon after release,
clusters of rhynchonelliforms of successive generations are
often found, with younger animals attached to older ones. In
genera (e.g. Neothyris, Anakinetica) that become free living
after outgrowing small anchors, the pedicle atrophies and
the shell becomes thickened near the hinge, so that the gape
is held above the surface sediment. A similar habit was
independently acquired by various fossil forms, some of
which (e.g. Gigantoproductus) were supported by spines
rather than differential weighting. See also: Meiosis</p>
      <p>Feeding is selective (phytoplankton preferred), with
oversize or otherwise unwanted particles rejected by local
changes in lophophore ciliary action or flicked away by a
tentacle. About two-thirds of particles in the 5–10 mm
range may be captured from the flow of c. 20–1200 mL
water h21 through the mantle cavity. Especially in
coldwater environments, brachiopod growth is seasonal, tissue
mass being lost in winter. Distinct growth bands are often
formed in the shell, and oxygen isotope (O18) composition
may be used to provide a high-resolution record of water
conditions at the time of shell secretion.</p>
      <p>In general, brachiopods are low-energy organisms.</p>
      <p>Their maximum oxygen demand is low and their
minimum demand vanishingly small. Only burrowing
linguloids are known to employ an oxygen-carrying protein
(haemerythrin). Individuals of some genera (e.g.
Terebratulina) have been kept unfed in seawater aquaria (at
108C) for as long as a year, after which much tissue had
been resorbed but the lophophore still functioned. The
persistence of brachiopods since the Early Cambrian may
reflect this ability to survive in cold environments with
scarce food. Both recent and fossil brachiopod shells
occasionally show predator damage and repair, but tissues
from living brachiopods are generally repellent to fish and
crustaceans, suggesting that chemical defences may also
have played some part in their long history.</p>
      <p>Fossil History
Brachiopod shells are relatively fragile. Nevertheless
brachiopods are among the earliest shelly fossils to appear in
Lower Cambrian strata (e.g. the Chengjiang fauna) and are
common fossils throughout the Palaeozoic because they
were among the dominant filter feeders until the Permo–
Triassic mass extinction, when their diversity fell by about
two-thirds to a new, fairly stable level (Figure 6). When
brachiopods were at their peak, before the rise of molluscs and
corals, they were among the principal reef builders in
shallow seas, but they also explored many other life styles
compatible with their structural limitations, including
scalloplike jet propulsion. No certain fossil phoronid is known, but
the Devonian trace fossil, Talpina, is a strong candidate,
comparable to extant Phoronis ovalis. See also: Extinction:
End-Permian mass extinction; Post-Permian radiation;

Phylogeny and Systematics
Metazoan animals are often divided into two categories,
protostomes and deuterostomes, according to how the
mouth, anus and coelom develop in the early embryo, and
the majority of modern zoologists have concluded that
brachiopods, phoronids and ectoproct bryozoans fit the
deuterostome pattern. Some earlier workers considered
brachiopods to be protostomes, although some also
recognized a mixture of features and put them in an intermediate</p>

or indeterminate position. Evidence from the comparison
of DNA sequences (some from the author’s laboratory)
shows that brachiopods and phoronids form a clade and
convincingly associates them with other undoubted
protostomes (e.g. annelids and molluscs) in a supra-phylum
alliance, the ‘lophotrochozoa’ (Figure 7). Thus, the
embryological and other morphological characters previously used
to define high-level brachiopod relationships are in doubt,
either because of unrecognized homoplasy or because they
are plesiomorphic, i.e. inherited from the last common
ancestor of both protostomes and deuterostomes. It may be
more realistic to define these alliances as DNA-based
clades, ‘Protostomozoa’ and ‘Deuterostomozoa’. See also:
Cladistics</p>
      <p>As with the origin of all phyla, the origin of
brachiopods remains enigmatic. Before the first undoubted
brachiopod fossils appear in the Lower Cambrian there
existed a quite varied fauna whose mineralized remains are
known as ‘small shelly fossils’, as well as somewhat more
brachiopod-like, but still enigmatic, forms such as Micrina
and Mickwitzia, any of which could represent the form of
the stem group from which brachiopods proper were
derived. More enigmatic still are slug-like animals such as
Halkieria, which combined a covering of mineralized
sclerites with superficially brachiopod-like anterior and
posterior shells. A notable similarity between living
brachiopods, annelids and some other lophotrochozoans is
provided by the ultrastructure and mode of development of
chitinous setae (chaetae), while at least superficial
similarities link brachiopod shell punctae and the aesthetes of
chiton shells (Mollusca: Polyplacophora). Moreover, some
gene trees place chitons very close to brachiopods, perhaps
because both have experienced low rates of gene sequence
evolution. Presumably these and other such enigmas reflect
the sorting out of ancestral morphological characters
during the period when stem group metazoans were diverging
into the distinct phyla we recognize today. See also:</p>
