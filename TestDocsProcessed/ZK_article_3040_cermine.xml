        <p>The Scratchpad Virtual Research Environment (http://scratchpads.eu/) is a flexible system for people to create their own research networks supporting natural history science. Here we describe Version 2 of the system characterised by the move to Drupal 7 as the Scratchpad core development framework and timed to coincide with the fifth year of the project's operation in late January 2012. The development of Scratchpad 2 reflects a combination of technical enhancements that make the project more sustainable, combined with new features intended to make the system more functional and easier to use. A roadmap outlining strategic plans for development of the Scratchpad project over the next two years concludes this article.</p>

      <p>In recent years the value of data as a primary research output has been increasingly
recognised (RIN 2011). New technology has made it possible to create, store and
reuse datasets, either for new analysis or for combination with other data in order to

answer different questions. Such data were typically made available as supplementary
files published alongside their respective papers or submitted to data repositories that
are linked back to the supporting publication. Either way, the act of data preservation
happened close to the time of publication, and usually some considerable period after
the dataset was initiated. This time lag acts as a major barrier to the development of
public archives for research data.</p>
      <p>At this crucial time when researchers would rather be dealing with the final
development of their paper and moving on to new projects, they are asked to deal with the
considerable challenge of formatting and depositing data, often using complex data
standards that may be unfamiliar to the contributors. In these circumstances
identifying the correct metadata to describe versions of these data is a major challenge,
particularly since research practices increasingly involve large multi-contributor datasets
that have developed and evolved over a considerable period of time (Smith 2009).
Coupled with concerns about the risk of exposing data before the originators have fully
exploited it, and the lack of standard norms for citing data, all but the most
committed researchers are likely to be unmoved by calls to publish their data. As a result, data
deposition is usually something of an afterthought for most researchers, with current
efforts arguably driven by mandates from research funders and journal editors, rather
than self-motivated individuals (Costello 2009).</p>
      <p>A solution to this problem is to embed the process of data creation, archival and
storage into a system that supports the research practices of the contributor community,
a process made easier by the steady migration away from paper-based note taking and
into direct electronic capture. This must support the data management needs of a project
from its inception through to publication and store the entire data workflow, taking
into account methodological steps that alter the data (such as equations and processing
algorithms) throughout. With this as a goal the collection of accurate metadata about the
lifecycle of these data can be captured, with the final data suitably structured for
archiving. This is especially important to researchers that would rather not hand off control of
their data to remote strangers. When the time comes to deposit data (at publication or
the end of funding), the relevant information could easily be transferred to a different,
public storage repository, or made more widely accessible within the system in which it
was created, for public access.</p>
      <p>A general class of systems that support this process are Virtual Research
Environments (VRE). Their purpose is to help researchers to work collaboratively by managing
the increasingly complex range of tasks involved in carrying out research on both small
and large scales (Carusi and Reimer 2010). The concept of VREs is still evolving, but
the term can be understood as a shorthand for the tools and technologies needed by
researchers to do their research, interact with other researchers (who may come from
different disciplines, institutions or countries) and to make use of resources and
technical infrastructures available at local, national, and sometimes international scales.
Critically, a VRE must incorporate the context in which those tools and technologies
are used. As a result the detailed design of a VRE will depend on many factors
including the research discipline and security requirements.</p>
      <p>Scratchpads (http://scratchpads.eu/) are an example of a VRE framework that has
been constructed to support the needs of specialists interested in natural history (Smith
et al. 2009). The system allows people to create their own website that supports the
particular needs of their research community by selecting a personalised choice of features,
visual design, and constituent data. Within any one Scratchpad network, users
selfassemble their data and activities, often around user-defined or imported vocabularies
(including biological classifications). These vocabularies provide a mechanism for
navigating and structuring content. They can also provide a quality control framework for
standardising certain types of data. Each Scratchpad includes service layers that provide
integration, analytical and publication functions that add considerable value to the user.
The original Scratchpad architecture is described in Smith et al. (2009), which details
the motivation for the project as well as the original technical framework that supports
the system. Two full time developers lead the technical development of the platform,
which is presently hosted on a single virtual server at the Natural History Museum,
London. Additional developers contributing software modules used by the Scratchpads
are based at several other institutions in the UK, continental Europe and the US.
Development proceeds according to an agile model with the overall vision and direction
managed by a wider group of stakeholders that are closely connected to the user community.</p>
      <p>In September 2011 there were over 300 Scratchpad community networks running on
the Scratchpad platform (http://scratchpads.eu/scratchpads/stats). Thematically, these
networks reflect the varied interests of natural historians, but can be broadly broken down into
sites concerning specific groups of taxa, biogeographic regions or projects and societies.
Networks range from 1 to 1,049 registered users (mean, 15, mode 1), and are composed of
a mix of professional scientists and amateur naturalists. Just 17 Scratchpad networks have
more than 50 contributors and almost half of all networks (129) have only one
contributor. Contributor number is not necessarily indicative of quality or impact of a network,
since two of the ten most visited Scratchpads have just two contributors each.
Collectively the Scratchpad platform had over 4,400 registered and active users who have
created 337,507 pages (nodes) of content between February 2007 and September 2011
(Figure 1). Scratchpad networks are free to all users. During January to September 2011 the
Scratchpads received an average of 41,000 unique visitors per month across the platform.</p>
      <p>February 2012 will mark the fifth anniversary of the Scratchpad project. It will
also mark the planned release of a major new version of the software that incorporates
many new features. This work is possible thanks to the EU FP7 funded ViBRANT
project (http://vbrant.eu/), which is an e-Infrastructure initiative designed to
support the development of virtual research communities. Additional support is
provided by the NERC funded eMonocot project (http://e-monocot.org/). This paper
provides a description of new features that will be released in Scratchpads 2, the
motivation behind their development, and a roadmap for the future development of the
Scratchpads over the next few years. As such it builds on the technical description of the
Scratchpads provided in Smith et al. (2009) and does not duplicate descriptions there
unless the concept or the functional component has changed substantially since
originally being described.
Since their inception the Scratchpads have been developed using the Drupal (http://
drupal.org/) Content Management System (CMS). Drupal offers a modular
framework within which core functionalities can be readily extended through the
development of new modules, or use of an extensive library of contributed modules. This
approach means that the Scratchpads can make use of an extremely large community of
contributing developers that provide core functionalities common to many web-based
applications (e.g. user management), in addition to a smaller pool of distributed
developers providing niche functionality that have general applications within the system
(e.g. bibliographic management). This makes the Scratchpad project more sustainable
as it allows funding to be focused on the development of functionality specific to the
biodiversity sector that is of direct application to the Scratchpads.</p>
      <p>The Scratchpads were initially released in Drupal version 5 as part of the EU
funded European Distributed Institute of Taxonomy project (EDIT,
http://www.etaxonomy.eu/). At the end of 2008 the Scratchpads were upgraded to Drupal version
6, and new modules have been constantly developed or modified since. Version 2 of
the Scratchpads has been developed using Drupal 7, which offers significant benefits
over previous versions (see Table 1).

Site management and distributed hosting
From April 2011 the Scratchpads adopted Ægir (Aegir, http://www.aegirproject.
org/) as a site management tool. This provides a Drupal based hosting front end
for the entire Scratchpad platform including all versions of the Scratchpads and
Scratchpad training sites. Our configuration for Aegir allows sign up data to be
automatically fed into the new site creation process, such that new sites can be set
up in just a few clicks. To register for a new Scratchpad a user just has to complete
a validated sign up form and the new Scratchpad is created automatically without
any intervention by the Scratchpad development team. Backup and site upgrades
are also managed by Aegir. Aegir also allows the Scratchpad team to deploy different
Scratchpad profiles that have been developed to support sites with a subset of the full
Scratchpad functionality (see below).</p>
      <p>User feedback surveys have indicated a strong desire by more experienced users
to host their own Scratchpads on a local server that is under their control. Until
recently all production Scratchpads (i.e. publicly accessible sites in long term use)
have been hosted at the NHM London. Attempts to host Scratchpads at other
institutions have occurred, but none of these have gone beyond an experimental
stage. As part of the ViBRANT project, technical development of the Scratchpads
has enabled the existing NHM sites to be mirrored at the Botanic Garden and
Botanical Museum Berlin (BGBM). In 2012, it will be possible to install new
production sites on the BGBM server and we anticipate additional servers to come
online in the near future. By distributing the hosting of the Scratchpads we hope
to reduce the overall load on the NHM server that increasingly often reaches its
performance limit when there are a high number of concurrent users. These
distributed sites will also be centrally managed through the Scratchpad Aegir site (http://
get.scratchpads.eu/).
Interest in the Scratchpad project is more and more coming from project based
initiatives in addition to individuals. The data-gathering needs of these projects
usually map to a subset of the full functionality offered by the Scratchpads, but
may require a high level of customisation and standardisation in order to support
the efforts of a particular initiative. Using the same site model as the Scratchpads,
these initiatives allow communities of users to construct data according to
templates specific to an initiative, and often have particular branding requirements that
identify that the sites are part of a common effort. As part of Scratchpad 2 we can
now support this functionality through the development of dedicated Scratchpad
profiles. These profiles contain configuration settings, a list of modules to install,
alternative themes and additional site setup settings that are specific to a particular
initiative. Modifications to the Aegir site management have enabled us to deploy
project specific profiles in the same way as regular Scratchpads. At present the
only project to make use of this functionality is eMonocot (http://e-monocot.org/),
which aims to create a global online resource for monocot plants by collating data
provided by taxonomists working through dedicated eMonocot Scratchpads. There
are, however, several potential applications for Scratchpad site profiles, including
the GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) nodes portal toolkit, which is
intended to be a mechanism for member countries to establish a web presence and
view a subset of relevant species observation records from GBIF (http://www.gbif.
org/). Another potential application of Scratchpad profiles are “LifeDesks” (http://
www.lifedesks.org/). These are currently deployed in Drupal 6 by the
Encyclopedia of Life (EOL) project (http://eol.org/) and are functionally very similar to the
Scratchpads.
The Scratchpad project is Open Source and released under a GPL version 2 license.
Originally the codebase was managed through a dedicated SVN repository. This
was converted to a Git repository (https://git.scratchpads.eu/) in February 2011 to
stay with the same system used by Drupal itself and to improve the development
environment.</p>
      <p>Within the repository there are two Scratchpad code branches. One (master) is
used for development and contains the latest version of the code. This is inevitably
unstable being the development environment, and it is less thoroughly tested than the
second (stable) code branch. Code is released to the stable branch on an intermittent
cycle, after it has been subjected to user acceptance testing by a trusted subsection of
the Scratchpad user community.
A common criticism of version 1 of the Scratchpads was that each site was a data silo
that lacked two-way connectivity to the wider landscape of biodiversity informatics
initiatives (Page 2009). This criticism is partially justified. Scratchpad taxon pages
provide significant inbound connectivity via the API’s of a diverse collection of
biodiversity projects and within the Scratchpads an increasing number of users are providing
data via outbound connectivity to third party projects such as the EOL. Also users
have long had the capability to create their own dynamic CSV or XML feeds on any
data type present within the Scratchpads. Despite these functions, usage of the
outbound connectivity from the Scratchpads is comparatively low. This problem will be
addressed within Scratchpad 2 by applying data services to all content by default, and
more prominently advertising the presence of these functions.</p>
      <p>Within Scratchpad 2 we will supply DwCA format, along with the appropriate
extensions, for the majority of content. In some cases DwCA format is
inappropriate or unsupported by external systems and services that are currently in use. For
example, EOL species pages presently harvest Scratchpad content in a version of
the Species Profile Model XML format. Likewise, the Scratchpad character project
exports data in a variety of well-known formats for which there is no obvious DwCA
extension. In these cases the present output formats (Structured Descriptive Data,
Lucid format and Nexus format) will be maintained to keep interoperability with a
wide array of third party applications.</p>
      <p>DwCA files will be created at regular intervals for each site, as a background task,
because building the archives is a comparatively slow process. We plan to drive this off
the underlying database so that the archives dynamically reflect modifications to the
structure of the site. Thus as new fields are added to the entity type, which define the
appropriate DwCA extension field, their content will be dynamically mapped to the
DwCA file when it is next created.
For each current Scratchpad site the maintaining user (i.e. the site coordinator
with administrative privileges) could choose between any of the default themes that
came with Drupal 6. Some maintainers also selected themes from those on Drupal.
org and requested that they be uploaded to their sites. Depending on the options
that came with each theme, users could select to have menu-bars on the left, right
or both sides of the page, customise the arrangement of content within these
menubars, and alter the colour scheme. As a consequence some Scratchpad maintainers
employed idiosyncratic layouts and colour schemes that did not make their site
visually appealing to the widest possible audience.</p>
      <p>As part of Scratchpad 2 this problem is addressed by the development of a new
dedicated Scratchpad theme that provides less layout and colour scheme flexibility.
This new theme will enforce compatibility with the Web Accessibility Initiative
(WAI) Double-A standards (http://www.w3.org/WAI/). The theme will
nevertheless offer a significant degree of customisation while allowing the Scratchpad
development team to exploit a higher degree of layout standardisation. The goal is
to present content in a more consistent and user-friendly way across all the sites.
Dedicated themes will be developed for separate site profiles as these come on
stream, allowing collections of sites to conform to the brands of commissioning
initiatives. Note that this design decision will present certain challenges for
existing sites, some of which may struggle to conform to the restrictions imposed by
the new site theme.
Users administrating version 1 of the Scratchpads found this a complex process
because many administration functions are not intuitive, hard to physically find on the
administrative interface, and when selected, their effect was often not immediately
apparent. As part of the Scratchpad 2 release the administration back end has been
completely redesigned with a new dedicated administration theme. This provides
more intuitive grouping for the administration functions and makes the link
between the cause and effect of each feature more obvious. For example, the options to
configure menu-bar content are directly accessible from the menu-bar and altering
these settings has an immediate visible effect. The administration functions also
benefit from the full width display of the overlay module that provides a visual indication
that the user is performing an administrative action.
Scratchpad taxon pages provide a mechanism for users to dynamically construct
and curate pages of information about any taxon selected from the site’s biological
taxonomy. These pages use taxonomic names as a search term to integrate tagged
content in a Scratchpad with third party content external to the site. This third
party content draws upon a variety of external data sources (e.g. Biodiversity
Heritage Library, flickr, GBIF and NCBI Genbank), which have suitable APIs that
support this type of integration.</p>
      <p>The original implementation of taxon pages in Scratchpads version 1 suffered
from a number of problems. These relate to the scientific accuracy of the third
party content, the content selection interface, and the visual presentation of
content, which may be poorly displayed and hard to organise for certain types of
data. In consequence, many Scratchpad communities do not use the taxon page
feature, or turn off the majority of third party content because the burden of
curating these pages outweighs their perceived benefit. As part of Scratchpads 2 the
taxon pages have been significantly re-engineered to address these issues, in part
by making much greater use of EOL species page content. This is a close match
to Scratchpad taxon page data. EOL provides a rich API that allows third party
projects to access this information. To this end Scratchpads version 2 will use EOL
as the primary provider for third party taxon page content. In addition we will
work with EOL to support the rating and verification of source material through
the API, such that registered Scratchpad users will be able to feed back to EOL
content ratings and validate the status of content. EOL species page content will
be integrated with existing Scratchpad taxon page content with the corresponding
source clearly identified. A filter will allow Scratchpad users to choose whether to
display just their Scratchpad Content, Scratchpad and trusted EOL content, or
Scratchpad and all EOL content. As in Scratchpads version 1, an on-demand
citation can be generated for any taxon page that creates a permanent archived version
of the page and a citation as well as a permanent URL for that page.
Scratchpads version 1 supports three types of maps:</p>
      <sec id="1-1">
        <title>1) Point locality maps using the Google Maps API and the gmaps module, which are</title>
        <p>constructed dynamically from any content type containing geolocation data. Point
locality maps are primarily used with Scratchpad specimen records but can also be
applied to other appropriate content such as users.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="1-2">
        <title>2) The recording of taxon presence / absence distributions conforming to the TDWG</title>
        <p>level 4 geographical scheme. This is enabled by the country maps module.
3) Third party distribution maps dynamically obtained from GBIF via their API.</p>
        <p>At present these maps are independent from each other and in consequence it is
possible for a user to display a species page showing three, potentially conflicting,
distribution maps for the same taxon. As part of Scratchpad 2 we will integrate these maps so
that point information, and regional distributions can be displayed together. This will
be implemented through an improved Google Maps module that incorporates version 3
of the Google Maps API. Feeds of georeferenced data from multiple sources (e.g. GBIF
and FLICKR) can be displayed as points on a map, in addition to areas
corresponding to TDWG level 4. As part of ongoing development work we plan to make these
externally supplied map points and their metadata locally editable, such that individual
records can be hidden, and point metadata edited locally within the Scratchpad.
Dynamic content templates and data import / export
Import mechanisms within Scratchpads version 1 operate on delimited text files for
any content type (e.g. tab or comma delimited files, usually generated by users from
spreadsheets). In addition, specific import mechanisms are provided for a limited
number of additional data types including biological taxonomies. As part of the Scratchpad
2 development, data can now be imported directly into a site using an Excel template,
omitting the need to convert the file into a delimited text file format. The template is
dynamically constructed from the Scratchpad, ensuring that it reflects any underlying
changes to the entity type, in much the same way that the DwCA and extension files
do. Furthermore, this Excel template can incorporate validation directly from the user’s
Scratchpad. For example, a user may wish to import specimen records that directly
link to a biological taxonomy that has already been embedded in the user’s site. The
template incorporates this taxonomy as a separate worksheet connected to the column
containing the specimen records taxon name so that records are validated before the
import. The goal is to improve the user experience and reduce the number of errors
that occur during data imports. The templates also contain embedded help text to
guide users through the process of preparing their data. Technically this is made
possible by the Drupal feeds module and the PHPExcel library.
Research on Scratchpads (Smith et al. 2010) and the Drupal CMS
(http://drupalusability.org/) suggest that navigating tasks involving multiple independent actions (e.g.
importing a biological taxonomy, or administrative tasks like adding new users) is the single
greatest usability issue within the system. The problem has a significant effect on user
retention because many users become frustrated when performing tasks that are
infrequently required but have a profound impact on their site. Likewise, the need to perform
complex actions, especially in the early stages of setting up a site, has been demonstrated
to be one of the biggest barriers to entry for many new users (Smith et al. 2010).</p>
        <p>In an attempt to address these issues the form-flow module has been developed by
the Scratchpad team. This supports the construction of workflows, which are a
mechanism to link together complex actions that would otherwise require the use of multiple
forms, editing environments and menu selections in pursuit of a single goal.
Formflow allows the Scratchpad development team to integrate multiple-step forms into a
single “flow”. When a user complets the series of forms, they are collectively submitted
as part of a single action. Error checks and validation are performed at every step, and
users can navigate backwards and forwards between the component forms without
loss of data. Within Scratchpad 2 form-flows exist for site setup functions; adding
users and associated permissions; importing content including biological taxonomies;
creating new entity types; publishing and exposing data through a service; and creating
customised views of data. The entry point to these form-flows will replace the existing
start point for these tasks, although maintainers will still have independent access to
the underlying elements of a form-flow. In addition, maintainers can construct
formflows through the user interface.
The matrix editor addresses the problem of how to edit multiple records for any
entity in an intuitive editing environment while making efficient use of space within
a webpage. The matrix editor emulates spreadsheet functionality in a web browser.
The module (http://drupal.org/project/slickgrid) makes use of the jQuery slickgrid
plugin (https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid) and defines a view-style in which
all data can be handled within an editable grid. Features of the slickgrid module
include grouping fields (to link logically connected fields); support for collapsible
taxonomy fields (tree structures, such as those representing biological classifications);
tabs (to organise columns under tabs); deletion of multiple entities (e.g. rows) via
the grid; multiple undo (to revert previous changes) and many more functions (see
the module description at http://drupal.org/project/slickgrid for full details).
The character project module is built on top of the slickgrid module and defines
specialised plugins dedicated to describing the molecular and morphological phenotype of
organisms. This enables users to manage complex collections of morphometric, text and
DNA character states that are optionally controlled via selection of a limited number
of predefined states. The data editor allows datasets to be entered, changed, and has
numerous features for manipulating rows, columns, and blocks of data, and for recoding
data. It supports the import and export of SDD (Structured Descriptive Data), Nexus
and Lucid data files, and is intended to provide the framework for a more integrated
suite of analytical and visualisation tools that will support the production of
identification keys, phylogenetic trees and natural language descriptions of taxa. The character
project module also makes use of the advanced entity relationships possible in Drupal</p>
        <sec id="1-2-1">
          <title>7. These allow metadata to be recorded about the connection between one or more entities. For example, within the character project this provides a common method for states to be annotated with images, text and bibliographic references present within a Scratchpad database.</title>
          <p>A major long-term goal for the Scratchpads is to support users throughout the
complete lifecycle of their data, from the inception of a project, through to its
publication. As part of Scratchpads version 1 a prototype module was built that
supported this functionality. This was outlined by Blagoderov et al. (2010) who
described a method to publish nomenclatural acts via Scratchpads that are
formally registered in the printed journal Zookeys. The workflow supports the
generation of manuscripts directly from the Scratchpad database and is extended in
Scratchpad 2 to support the construction of a wider range of datasets and
manuscripts for submission to several additional endpoints. Within the first release of
Scratchpads 2 these endpoints are limited to the major Pensoft series of journals
(Zookeys, Phytokeys, and Mycokeys), as well as the construction of Red List Threat
Assessments (Figure 2). The latter enable Scratchpad users to document the risk of
extinction to species within a political management unit according to precise
criteria defined by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Other
publishers can implement software to handle the XML output from a Scratchpad,
delivered in the open TaxPub schema, and, once available, their journals can be
added to the list of possible endpoints.</p>
          <p>When the publisher’s API supports feedback mechanisms (such as comments
received through peer review) the module will be further developed to automatically
update the publication, with the goal of speeding up the process of editing the final
document while maintaining an enduring link to the supporting data.
Help and support services
The Scratchpads have employed a variety of mechanisms over the past five years to
support users (see Brake et al., this volume for a full review). Despite these advances,
providing adequate support to a rapidly growing number of users remains an ongoing
challenge. This is a particular problem with agile software development methods that
can result in the rapid development of user interfaces, which occasionally require users
to relearn tasks they previously performed by another method. To address this a help
desk was formally established with the appointment of a dedicated user support
manager in January 2010. The help desk deals with all the emails, issues, calls and meetings
relating to user support. In September 2010 a custom-built issues tracker (http://dev.
scratchpads.eu/project/issues) was developed that provided a mechanism for
administrative users to report bugs, access support and make feature requests directly from
their own Scratchpad, without the need to log into a separate system.</p>
          <p>As part of the ViBRANT programme, basic and advanced training courses were
organised to support and extend the Scratchpad userbase. These one-day courses are
free of charge, paid for under the ViBRANT grant, and are intended to help current
and prospective Scratchpad owners develop their site building skills, learn best
practices and gain a better understanding of what Scratchpads can do for their research
communities. A distance learning package has also been developed for those unable
to attend a training course in person. Further, the help system has been extensively
re-developed to become context-sensitive which helps novice users to control their
Scratchpads. Throughout 2011 an extensive survey has been undertaken to further
identify how the needs of users can be better supported. Full details of this are available
in Brake et al. (2011) published in this volume.
Prioritisation of these development activities for Scratchpad 2 have been conducted in close
coordination with the user community, via feedback mechanisms that have been
solicited and collated by a team within the ViBRANT project. This work has provided insight
into the technical and social challenges faced by contributors when using the Scratchpads.
Research into the motivation behind user engagement with the Scratchpads (Smith et al.
2010), has also led to the development of technical innovations designed to sustain
engagement and expand the existing userbase. With these results in mind the development of
Scratchpads 2 reflects a combination of backend enhancements intended to make the
techhttp://milichiidae.info/content/citation). In an effort to formalise these outputs so
that they are independently registered and citable we will be exploring the
assignment of CrossRef DOIs to journal articles, and DataCite DOIs to datasets.
Implementation of this function raises a challenge with respect to distributing the hosting
of the Scratchpads and the maintenance of URL links. Nevertheless, this is an
essential step for this output to become more readily accepted as formal scholarly content.
The Scratchpad home site (http://scratchpads.eu) will be rebuilt with an emphasis
on dynamically showcasing content from current Scratchpads, rather than
emphasising the software.</p>
          <p>There will be greater integration of external analytical and vocabulary services into
the Scratchpads. These will be driven by new developments from the ViBRANT
programme, and include access to the catalogue of services available to the Oxford
Batch Operation Engine (https://oboe.oerc.ox.ac.uk/) and developments to the
GBIF controlled vocabularies server (http://vocabularies.gbif.org/).</p>
          <p>The Scratchpad training materials will be redeveloped with both botanical and
zoological examples and will include support for training non-maintainer
contributors from within a single taxonomic community (presently these materials focus
on maintainers from multiple communities). As part of this redevelopment we will
incorporate more standardised approaches to the training content that clarify the
goal of a training task, alongside the prerequisites for its delivery, rather than just
providing a set of step-by-step instructions and screenshots.</p>
          <p>An ongoing issue with the Scratchpads and all e-infrastructure projects is finding an
enduring model that secures their financial sustainability. In practice a mixed approach
will be necessary for the Scratchpads, which relies on a combination of core support from
institutions with a vested interest in the project, in addition to funds from external grant
awarding bodies to drive innovation and new developments. As part of this mixed model
we will be looking at opportunities to raise modest amounts of revenue from existing
Scratchpad communities. This will take the form of value-added services such as priority
technical support, maintenance of a persistent resolver for DOI identifiers on content,
and data parsing services to facilitate the rapid construction of site.
We describe Scratchpads 2, a Virtual Research Environment supporting scholarly
collaboration, communication and data publication in biodiversity science. This represents a
significant upgrade on the existing Scratchpad infrastructure. The original system has been
in operation for five years demonstrating a clear demand for a structure of this type. The
changes described here considerably expand the technical stability and functional
capabilities of the system allowing the infrastructure to continue to grow at a sustainable cost. These
changes include new tools to manage the distribution and hosting of sites, data services
on all content, more consistent theming, new taxon pages, integrated mapping, dynamic
content templates, workflows, new data editing environments, a new publication module
and improved user-support functions. The guiding principle used during the development
of Scratchpads 2 has been to construct a scholarly communication system that closely
resembles and is intertwined with the scholarly pursuit of natural history, rather than being
its after-thought or annex. We would be the first to admit that Scratchpad 2 does not fully
deliver this aspiration, but we believe that it lays sustainable groundwork towards this goal.

VSS designs and leads the project, and coordinates the biological, sociological and
technical insight that defines the Scratchpad program of work. SDR leads all aspects of the
technical development, writing and integrating the package of software and providing
the system administration. SDR also manages the additional technical developers
including BS who has designed and constructed many of the complex editing and publication
interfaces present within Scratchpad 2. EB has developed the profile functionality within
the Scratchpads, in particular the eMonocot profile and associated training materials.
EB alongside IB, LL, DR and VB provide selected testing and user support. IB leads the
user support work and development of the training materials. DR realised, with VSS,
the original Scratchpad implementation under the EU project EDIT (contract number
018340) and project manages the Scratchpads as part of the ViBRANT project, tests
modules and develops selected functionality on selected sites. VSS wrote the manuscript.
Other authors provided editorial comments and approved the final draft.
This work has been supported by the EU funded FP7 ViBRANT project (contract
